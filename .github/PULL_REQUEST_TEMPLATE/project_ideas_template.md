Hi Viettech! I want to suggest the following resources and/or project ideas:
1. _link_; tags: beginner, python, newtag; prereqs: python
2. _another-link_; tags: immediate, webdev; prereqs: None

Cc @chauvm

### Guidelines
1. Free resources preferred
2. Duration tags:
- `short`: couple of hours
- `long`: couple of days
3. Difficulty tags:
- `beginner`: for those who have taken 1-2 intro to programming courses
- `intermediate`: for those who have taken >= 3 programming courses
- `advanced`: for those who want to drill into a specific topic
